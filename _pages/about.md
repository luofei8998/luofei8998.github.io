I am an Assistant Professor at Computer Science, [Great Bay University](https://www.gbu.edu.cn/?lang=en), and also a visiting scholar at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I am currently leading an IoT and Smart Sensing Lab. I recently moved from the [Honor Device Co., Ltd.](https://www.hihonor.com/global/), Shenzhen where I worked as a chief engineer.  I was a Postdoctoral researcher at Shenzhen University, working with [Prof. Kaishun Wu](https://www.kaishunwu.com/).  I received my Ph.D. degree in Electronic Engineering at the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London in 2020 (supervised by [Prof. Eliane Bodanese](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/people/profiles/bodaneseeliane.html)).
My research focuses on the following areas:
1. **Human activity recognition**: identifying the specific movement or action of a person based on the integration of various sensor data and machine learning techniques.
1. **Wireless sensing**: monitoring conditions and changes of targets and environments via various wireless techniques including WiFi, sound, Radar, Lidar, etc.
1. **Edge intelligence**: a combination of AI and Edge Computing that enables the deployment of machine learning algorithms to the edge device by using model compression, model partition, conditional computation, etc.
1. **Multimodal fusion**: exploring suitable deep learning architectures to fuse the data from multiple modalities for improving the performance of related tasks.

**I am recruiting PostDocs (more than 35W/year) and Research Assistants (PhD or excellent master candidates) to join my research team. For prospective collaborators, please email me your CV and research plan. 每年招收湾大-深大联培硕士，湾大-哈工深联培博士若干**
